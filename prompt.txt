Create a simple Phaser 3 game that runs in the browser. The player should be a red square that can move left and right using the arrow keys, and jump using the up arrow key. There should be platforms to stand on, gravity enabled, and a sky-blue background.

Use only one HTML file with all the JS code inside a <script> tag so I can test it quickly.
